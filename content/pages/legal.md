## Liability for content

As a service provider we are responsible for own contents on these pages under the general laws. We are not obliged as a service provider to monitor transmitted or stored foreign information or to investigate circumstances that indicate illegal activity. Obligations to remove or block the use of information under the general laws remain unaffected. However, liability is only possible from the date of knowledge of a specific infringement. Upon notification of such violations, we will remove the content immediately.

<br />

## Liability for links

Our offer contains links to external websites over which we have no control. Therefore we can not accept any responsibility for their content. The respective provider or operator of the pages is always responsible for the content of linked pages. The linked sites were checked at the time of linking for possible violations of law. Illegal contents were not recognizable. A permanent control of the linked pages is unreasonable without concrete evidence of a violation. Upon notification of violations, we will remove such links immediately.
