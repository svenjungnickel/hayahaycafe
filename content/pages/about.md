## Food Virtuous



A few years ago, there’s was absolutely little to no options for something healthy, clean and easy foods. There was a big gap in the market of vegetarian and vegan options. So at 25, I decided to venture on this journey, to challenge myself to create a menu and environment that would promote the well being and sustainability within the community. 

So, from day one, I decided that I would take a home made approached to our menus. 

Most of our food is 100% vegetarian and vegan, we aim to be at least 110% awesome in everything we do. Many of our dishes are easily adjusted to gluten free options or to its desire.

## Local Approach/ community

Small businesses are still the heart of the island. After all its just a small island, therefore, we personally know the people behind every local businesses which is where we get most of our products and services. Our approach on supporting local gives us the best benefits to achieve our goal on sustainability, fresh, better quality and at the same time providing a place for everyone to be happy to live and work in. 

We seek to establish partnerships with local growers + suppliers whenever possible. 

We are a scratch kitchen that focuses on utilizing local vendors, sustainable businesses practices, and seeking to give more than we take.

We offer a wide variety of menu items that are accessible to many dietary restrictions, and we cultivate an environment of inclusivity.

Our menu items are free of artificial colors, preservatives and  flavors, We make food to nourish our community with fresh ingredients. We are both a neighbourhood gathering place and a world-wide destination.
