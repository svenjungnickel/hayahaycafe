We’re back for dinner — 5pm to 10pm — with a menu that bridges our island roots and the flavors of our travels.

Expect raw, dry-aged, and cured fish, inspired by the vibrant traditions of ceviche and kinilaw, reimagined through new techniques and influences from around the world.

It’s island soul with a modern touch - familiar, yet refreshingly different. 🐟
